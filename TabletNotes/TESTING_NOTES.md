## Update 3 - Network Disconnection Fix
**Build Date:** October 25, 2025

### What Was Fixed
Fixed a critical crash that occurred when:
1. Recording was in progress with live transcription active
2. WiFi/network was turned off or lost connection
3. App would crash or become unresponsive

### What Changed
- Live transcription now gracefully handles network disconnections
- Audio recording continues uninterrupted when network is lost
- Added 10-second timeout to network requests to prevent hanging
- WebSocket connections close cleanly when network fails
- User sees friendly error message instead of crash

### What to Test

**Test 1: WiFi Disconnection During Recording**
1. Start a new recording
2. Let it record for ~30 seconds with live transcription active
3. Turn OFF WiFi on your phone
4. **Expected:**
   - App does NOT crash
   - Recording continues
   - Live transcription stops
   - Message shown: "Network connection lost. Recording continues, but live transcription is paused."
5. Turn WiFi back ON
6. Stop recording normally
7. **Expected:** Audio file is complete with no gaps

**Test 2: Airplane Mode During Recording**
1. Start recording
2. Enable Airplane Mode after 1 minute
3. **Expected:** Same graceful behavior as Test 1
4. Continue recording for another minute
5. Disable Airplane Mode
6. Stop recording
7. **Expected:** Full audio captured, no data loss

**Test 3: Poor Network Conditions**
1. Start recording in area with spotty WiFi
2. Let network drop and reconnect naturally
3. **Expected:** App handles intermittent connection without crashing
4. Recording remains stable throughout

**Test 4: Network Loss During Startup**
1. Turn OFF WiFi before opening app
2. Open app and try to start recording
3. **Expected:**
   - Recording still works (local only)
   - Transcription may not start or shows error
   - No crash or hang

### Known Behaviors
- Live transcription requires active network connection
- When network is lost, transcription pauses but recording continues
- Audio is saved locally and can be transcribed later
- Reconnecting network does NOT auto-resume live transcription (must stop/start recording)

### What to Report
If you encounter any issues:
1. When did the network loss occur (during recording start, middle, end)?
2. Did the app crash, freeze, or show an error message?
3. Was the audio file saved completely?
4. Any error messages displayed?
