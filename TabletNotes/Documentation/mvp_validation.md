## MVP Scope Assessment

The enhanced documents maintain focus on the core MVP while providing a solid foundation for future growth. The following considerations ensure the MVP remains achievable:

1. **Core vs. Extended Features**: Clear distinction between MVP features and future enhancements
2. **Technical Complexity**: Architecture supports MVP needs without overengineering
3. **Development Timeline**: Enhanced architecture supports the 6-week timeline in the original PRD
4. **Resource Constraints**: Implementation complexity is appropriate for a small development team
5. **User Value**: All enhancements directly contribute to the core user experience

## Recommendations for MVP Implementation

1. **Phased Approach**: Implement core recording and transcription features first
2. **Early Integration**: Begin AssemblyAI integration early to identify any challenges
3. **Continuous Testing**: Implement testing from the start, especially for critical user flows
4. **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags to enable gradual feature rollout
5. **User Feedback**: Implement analytics early to gather usage data during beta

## Conclusion

The enhanced PRD and architecture documents provide a comprehensive foundation for the TabletNotes app MVP. All previously identified gaps have been addressed with practical, implementable solutions that maintain focus on the core MVP requirements while establishing a solid foundation for future growth.

The architecture is technically feasible and aligned with modern iOS development practices, utilizing SwiftUI, Combine, and SwiftData effectively. The enhanced documents provide clear guidance for implementation while maintaining flexibility for the development team to make tactical decisions during implementation.
